# Regresssion-Analysis
This project was completed as part of a graduate level Regression Analysis course, in collaboration with 2 classmates. We analyzed a dataset containing information on dog breeds, sizes, and intelligence level, with the goal of understanding how these variables relate to one another through statistical modeling.
